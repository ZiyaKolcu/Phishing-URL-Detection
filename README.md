# Phishing URL Detection

## Project Purpose

This project aims to detect phishing URLs using machine learning techniques. By leveraging NLP-based URL analysis, the model identifies patterns and characteristics that differentiate phishing links from legitimate ones. A logistic regression model is employed to classify URLs, making it an efficient and interpretable solution for phishing detection. This project aims to enhance cybersecurity by providing a reliable and automated approach to identifying malicious URLs.
